RabbitMQ is a messaging queue service which is server based 

can use Pika library to connect to the server and write publisher and consumer codes and set exchangeytpe in publisher 
As per code and design :-
        Pika connetces declare the exchange name ,type ,queue name ,properties etc as per requirement.

        channel.exchange_declare(exchange='logs', exchange_type='fanout') to create name ref for a exchange type in RabbitMQ(can be used by any)
        channel.queue_bind(exchange='logs', queue=queue_name)   - to bind the exchange (used by consumer mostly)
        channel.queue_declare(queue='', exclusive=True)   - to create a queue,can be used by any 
    Its not that the publisher code cannot use any Apis that is ments for the consumer , the Library is same its all about the design requirements

                    this is rabbit MQ server

Exchange :--->
---------------
  * A exchange in RabbitMQ is a entity that defines in which queue the message should be places 
  * the producer directly dont place the message in the queue using it places it in the Exchange and then the exchange is 
    responsinble to place it in the proper Queue based on the routing info.
   types of exchanges:

    1. 'direct'    :-  by default if we specify '' then its direct .
    2. 'topic'     :-  
    3. 'headers' 
    4. 'fanout' 
  These exchange types defines the logic of message trancefer in RabbitMQ
  external plugins can also be installed to exted the exchange scope

NOTE:- to place it in a scpecific Queue we define a binding in the consuper code that directs the Excenge to place it in the Queue

Publisher/producer :--->
-------------------
* This is written in code to publish the message to a specific exchange type and with a routing key(based on the exchange type and routing key exchange takes actions)
* publisher sets the exchange name and exchange type (exchange name is used as a reference latter,default name can also be used by the rabbitMQ)
* then it publishes the message using the exchange name ,routing key,properties and body to the exchange
